<h3>about</h3>
<p style="width: 75%">Max Puchalsky (b. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/" target="_blank">354.39 ppm</a>) is an artist and organizer who explores the intersections of new media and social practice to prefigure egalitarian potentialities. He has transformed art galleries into public commons for utopian (re)creation, collaborated with public libraries to curate special collections of radical texts (including zines, music, and games), created iconic graphics for autonomous, working-class, LGBTQ+, and ecological organizations, and facilitated workshops for visionary storytelling at forest defense occupations.
<br><br>
Puchalsky has participated in over 70 exhibitions in 9 countries and his work has been featured in over 50 reviews and publications. He is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships including the Future Art Award: Ecosystem X (2022), Madison Arts Commission Individual Artist Fellowship (2021), and M List Award: Innovation in the Arts (2018).
<br><br>
His teaching experience includes the University of Wisconsin–Madison Art Department, Arts + Literature Laboratory, the Institute for Social Ecology, and the Bayview International Center for Education and The Arts.
<br><br>
A member of the artist collective <a href="https://www.solarpunksurf.club" target="_blank">Solarpunk Surf Club</a>, his current research focuses on solidarity economics, liberatory ecotechnologies, and (more-than)human ethics through an ecology of forms, spanning images, objects, stories, and situations.
<br><br>
Puchalsky holds an MFA in Studio Art (2020), MA in Studio Art (2019), BA in Music Performance (2013), and BA in Political Science (2013) from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and has studied at Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands. 
<br><br>
He lives and works in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
